02 Arrays and Strings

1. When to use String vs. StringBuilder in C#? 
   Use String for immutable text.  
   Use StringBuilder for mutable text when performing many modifications to avoid creating multiple objects.

2. What is the base class for all arrays in C#?
   System.Array.

3. How do you sort an array in C#? 
   Use Array.Sort(array).

4. What property of an array object can be used to get the total number of elements in an array?  
   Length.

5. Can you store multiple data types in System.Array?**  
   No, System.Array is type-safe and can store elements of only one data type.  
   (Unless the type is object, but this is not recommended for type safety.)

6. Whatâ€™s the difference between System.Array.CopyTo() and System.Array.Clone()?  
   CopyTo(): Copies elements into an existing array.  
   Clone(): Creates a shallow copy of the entire array.
